# Bookie!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mjdubell/Bookie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mjdubell/Bookie)

**Bookie** is a simple Django app that stores links to information you intend to consume later. For example, if you found yourself bookmarking information from social media and websites, but your bookmarks are stored all over the place *and* you also forget to check what you have saved, then Bookie is for you!

*Right now, you can only save links through Telegram.*

## Motivation

I save a lot of links, tweets and articles that I intend to read later, but I always forget to actually check my what I have saved. On twitter I use the *like* or *bookmark* functionality to save interesting tweets for later. Sometimes I save them to my *Saved messages* on Telegram or use the Google Inbox bookmark functionality. Needless to say, I need a single source which stores all my links and notifies me after some period of time to remind me what I recently saved. And so Bookie was born.


## Vision

My vision for Bookie includes:
- Mobile app
- Browser extension to save links directly from the browser
- More integrated services
- To be the number one source for all your saved links

## Local Development

If you want to add features to Bookie, you have a few options to run it locally:
1. Docker
2. Docker in Vagrant
3. Vagrant
4. Native

I personally use option 2 because I am using Windows and I have Virtualbox installed which doesn't play nice with docker :/

When running locally, the telegram integration wont work out of the box, you will need to register your own bot and use something like https://ngrok.com/. But this isn't necessary unless you are specifically developing features using telegram. Therefore Bookie will just set the telegram token to `123` unless otherwise specified.

Use the guideline below to start developing locally with vagrant and docker. If you don't want to use vagrant, simply skip the vagrant part and run `docker-compose`.
```
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ cd /vagrant_data
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:/vagrant_data$ sudo docker-compose -f dev.yml up -d  
```

Now your local Bookie instance should be available on `http://localhost:8000` on your host machine.

### Running tests locally

Tests should be run using Django, like below:

```
python manage.py test --settings=bookie.env.test
```

## Run your own Bookie installation

Right now, Bookie uses telegram to send data to Bookie. Therefore you need your own Telegram bot which you can read more about here [https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot).

Once you have acquired your bot for bookie, you need to set a webhook to your Bookie intsallation. Your installation needs to be accessible from the Internet.

```
http POST https://api.telegram.org/bot<API_KEY>/setWebhook url=<YOUR_HOST>/api/telegram/API_KEY/
```

Bookie is designed to use docker for running in production while the vagrant and default setup is for local development.

### Default setup

1. Clone the repo
2. `pip install pipenv --user`
3. `pipenv shell`
4. `pipenv install`
5. Set your telegram api key
```
# Windows
set TELEGRAM_API_KEY=<api_key>

# Unix
export TELEGRAM_API_KEY=<api_key>
```
6. `python manage.py runserver --settings=bookie.env.dev` *(Run bookie in development mode)*

### Vagrant setup

1. vagrant up && vagrant ssh
2. Set your telegram api key
```
export TELEGRAM_API_KEY=<api_key>
```
3. cd /vagrant_data
4. Run Boookie
```
python3.7 manage.py runserver --settings=bookie.env.dev 0.0.0.0:8000
```
5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 on your host machine     

### Docker setup (Production)

1. Create `/root/bookie.env` with the following contents:
```
TELEGRAM_API_KEY=
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=
ALLOWED_DOMAINS=yourdomain.com,www.yourdomain.com
SENTRY_KEY=
```
2. `sudo docker-compose -f prod.yml up -d`

This will start a docker container listening on the host at `127.0.0.1:8000`. You will need to configure nginx or apache as a reverse proxy to serve static content, below you will find an nginx configuration example.

```
upstream bookie.local {
    server 127.0.0.1:8000;
}


server {
